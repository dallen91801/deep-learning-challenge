Alphabet Soup Success Predictor - Predict Funding Success for Nonprofits Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks
# Alphabet Soup Neural Network Model Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis aims to create a deep learning model to assist Alphabet Soup in predicting whether funding applicants will be successful. It involves preprocessing the data, designing and training a neural network model, and evaluating its performance to meet the target accuracy of 75% or higher.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- **Target Variable(s):**

  - `IS_SUCCESSFUL`: This variable indicates whether an applicant was successful (1) or not (0).

- **Feature Variable(s):**

  - All other columns, except for `EIN`, `NAME`, and `IS_SUCCESSFUL`, were used as features after preprocessing.

- **Removed Variable(s):**

  - `EIN`: A unique identifier not relevant for prediction.
  - `NAME`: Contains textual data that is not directly useful for the model.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **Model Architecture:**

  - **Neurons:**
    - First hidden layer: 80 neurons
    - Second hidden layer: 30 neurons
    - Output layer: 1 neuron (for binary classification)
  - **Layers:**
    - Input layer: Accepts the features.
    - Hidden layers: Two layers using ReLU activation for non-linearity.
    - Output layer: Uses sigmoid activation for binary classification.
  - **Activation Functions:**
    - ReLU for the hidden layers to efficiently handle non-linear relationships.
    - Sigmoid for the output layer to predict probabilities for binary classification.

- **Model Performance:**

  - **Google Colab Results:**
    - Test Loss: 0.6909
    - Test Accuracy: 53.41%
  - **Local Neural Network Results:**
    - Test Loss: 0.7314
    - Test Accuracy: 64.10%
  - The target accuracy of 75% was not achieved in either environment.

- **Optimization Steps:**

  1. **Data Binning:**
     - Rare occurrences in `APPLICATION_TYPE` and `CLASSIFICATION` were grouped into "Other" categories to reduce noise.
  2. **Feature Scaling:**
     - Standardized the feature data using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contributed equally to the model.
  3. **Architectural Adjustments:**
     - Increased the number of neurons in the hidden layers.
     - Experimented with additional hidden layers.
     - Adjusted the number of epochs and batch sizes for training.

## Summary

The neural network model created for this analysis did not meet the target performance of 75% accuracy. Despite preprocessing the data and optimizing the architecture, the model's accuracy plateaued at 64.10%.

### Recommendations

To improve performance, consider the following:

1. **Try a Different Model:**

   - **Random Forest Classifier:** Often effective for categorical data and can capture non-linear relationships.
   - **Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost):** Known for high performance on tabular data.

2. **Additional Feature Engineering:**

   - Analyze the dataset for new feature combinations or transformations that may improve predictive power.
   - Use domain knowledge to derive new meaningful features.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**

   - Perform a grid search or use automated tools like `Keras Tuner` to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of neurons, learning rate, and batch size.

By exploring these alternatives, Alphabet Soup can achieve better predictive accuracy for funding success.
